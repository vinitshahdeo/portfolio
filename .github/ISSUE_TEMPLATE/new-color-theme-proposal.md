## New Color Theme Proposal

### Description

Propose a new color theme for the portfolio with distinct colors for:

- **Headings**
- **Body text**
- **Background**

### Requirements

- The new theme should include **light and dark variants**.
- A **theme switch button** should be added to allow users to toggle between the light and dark versions of the theme.
- The theme must be **responsive** and work seamlessly across different devices and screen sizes.

### Color Scheme

Please provide the proposed color values for both light and dark variants:

#### Light Theme:

- **Headings**: [Provide color]
- **Body Text**: [Provide color]
- **Background**: [Provide color]

#### Dark Theme:

- **Headings**: [Provide color]
- **Body Text**: [Provide color]
- **Background**: [Provide color]

### Design Considerations

- The **font-family should not be changed**; only the color scheme is being updated.
- Ensure that the colors enhance readability and provide a pleasant user experience.
- The color switch should persist across sessions (preferably using local storage or cookies).

### Resources

- Refer to the [README](https://github.com/vinitshahdeo/portfolio/blob/main/README.md) for instructions on setting up the project.
- Please follow the [Contributing Guidelines](https://github.com/vinitshahdeo/portfolio/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md) when submitting a pull request.
