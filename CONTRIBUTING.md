# Contributing to [Stellar Astro Dev Portfolio](https://astro.build/themes/details/stellar-astro-dev-portfolio/)

We’re thrilled that you’re interested in contributing! Whether you're here to:

- Report a bug
- Discuss the current state of the code
- Submit a new theme or feature
- Propose new styles or improvements

We want to make the process as simple and transparent as possible.

## How We Work

We use [GitHub](https://github.com/vinitshahdeo/portfolio) for hosting our code, tracking issues, and managing feature requests. All code changes happen through pull requests, following [GitHub Flow](https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/index.html). Your contributions—whether big or small—are always welcome!

## Development Workflow

To keep things organized and maintain high code quality, please follow this workflow:

1. **Fork the repository** and create your branch from `main`.
2. **Create clear, descriptive commit messages** for all changes.
3. **Submit your pull request to the `develop` branch** (not directly to `main`).
4. **Ensure your code passes linting checks**.
5. Submit the pull request and wait for review!

If you’re new to GitHub Flow, check out this [guide](https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/index.html).

### Helpful Tips

- Please refer to [`README.md`](./README.md) for local setup instructions.
- Reference related issues in your pull request description to provide context.
- Please ping [@vinit_shahdeo](https://x.com/vinit_shahdeo) if your pull request is not reviewed within three days.
